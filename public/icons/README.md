# Icon Requirements for Ora Browser Landing Page

This directory should contain the minimal required icons for the Ora Browser landing page.

## Required Icons (Minimal Setup)

### Basic Favicon Icons
- `favicon.svg` - SVG format (light theme)
- `favicon-dark.svg` - SVG format (dark theme)

These two SVG icons are sufficient for the landing page as they:
- Support both light and dark theme preferences
- Scale perfectly at any size
- Provide modern browser compatibility
- Keep the setup minimal and focused

## Design Guidelines

### Visual Style
- Clean, minimal design that represents the Ora Browser brand
- Recognizable at small sizes (16x16px when rasterized)
- Good contrast for both light and dark backgrounds
- Consistent with the "beautiful browser" positioning

### Technical Specifications
- **Format**: SVG (Scalable Vector Graphics)
- **Color**: Solid colors, avoid gradients for better compatibility
- **Size**: Optimized file size while maintaining quality
- **Compatibility**: Modern browsers with SVG favicon support

### Theme Considerations
- **Light theme** (`favicon.svg`): Should work well on white/light backgrounds
- **Dark theme** (`favicon-dark.svg`): Should work well on black/dark backgrounds
- Use appropriate colors that maintain brand consistency
